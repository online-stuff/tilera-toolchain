# tilera-toolchain

This is a work-in-progress and I half-expect it not to work..  This is my 'scrachpad' for working on it when I get time and the desire.

Cross ToolChains for tilera (tilepro and tilegx). This is a shell script that
permit the building of cross toolchain for tilera.

Clone this repository and then run ./tilera-pro.sh or ./tilera-gx.sh

All output is in the install folder.
